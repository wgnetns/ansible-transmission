    short_description: Wireguard-ed Transmission setup
    description: |
      Set up a headless Transmission server isolated in a network namespace of its own, with all BitTorrent traffic routed through a Wireguard interface. This can be used to ensure that BitTorrent traffic stays within a VPN.

      Additionally, if someone breaks into the Transmission server, the network namespace makes it harder for them to (ab)use your real Internet connection.
